### Tips
```pytest -rA --verbose``` - best way to run tests because it is informative

```pytest -k lambdatest -rA -v``` - will run all tests that contain string "lambdatest"

```pytest -k [fileName.py]::[test_nameInTheFile] -rA -v``` - will run a specific test from a specific file

```pytest -m smoke``` - will run tests marked by ```@pytest.mark.smoke```

```pytest --disable-warnings``` - disables warnings

```pytest -m "smoke and integration"``` - will run tests marked as smoke and integration

```pytest -m "smoke and not integration"``` - will run tests marked as smoke but will not run integration

```pytest -m "smoke or integration"``` - will run tests marked as smoke or integration

```pytest --collectonly test_parameters.py``` - will collect and check files classes and functions but does not  run tests

```pytest tests --html=AutomationPageObjectReport.html``` - will run tests in tests folder and generate HTML report (install Pytest-HTML before that)
